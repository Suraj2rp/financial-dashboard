## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and a package manager like npm or yarn installed on your system.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-dashboard.git
    cd financial-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## üìÑ CSV Data Format

To use the "Upload CSV" feature, your CSV file must adhere to a specific format.

- The file **must** have a header row: `type,col1,col2,col3,col4`
- Each subsequent row represents a piece of data, identified by the `type` column.

Here are the expected formats for each `type`:

| Type | col1 (string) | col2 (string/number) | col3 (string/number) | col4 (number) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **client** | `Category Name` | `Value` | *(empty)* | *(empty)* | Data for the **Clients** donut chart. |
| **sip** | `Month` | `UV Value` | `PV Value` | *(empty)* | Data for the **SIP Business** bar/line chart. |
| **mis** | `Month` | `UV Value` | `PV Value` | `AMT Value` | Data for the **Monthly MIS** area chart. |
| **stat** | `Title` | `Value` | `Detail` | *(empty)* | Data for the summary **Stat Cards**. |

### Example CSV (`test/demo.csv`)

```csv
type,col1,col2,col3,col4
client,Online CSV,5000,,
client,New CSV,750,,
sip,Jan,2.5,130,
mis,Jan,0.55,0.35,0.45
stat,Purchases,75,15.00 Cr,
```

You can use the provided `test/demo.csv` file to test the upload functionality.
